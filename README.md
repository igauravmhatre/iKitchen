iKitchen Website


It's bascially a website meant to explore food recipes, which can be accesse by different roles(User, Restauranteur, Admin),
with different functionality(E.g:- adding and Posting Recipes, Adding Advertisment Content, Sign-in- Sign-Up Process).
So on the Backend part it's PHP/Mysql, and the front-end part is created with Boostrap.
Also, includes the SQL file.
